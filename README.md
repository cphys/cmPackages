# Mathematica Packages
-  A collection of various mathematica packages which I have used for
calculations as well as creating plots.

-  Each package contains functions which can be called once the 
packages are [installed](https://support.wolfram.com/5648?src=mathematica).

- Documentation on usage of the functions is located at the begining of 
each of the .m files.

# To Do
- This is an initial commit as I start to collect various packages which 
I have created over the years. The documentation will need to be expanded 
and it may become necessary to break this into multiple repositories based 
on subject matter as packages are added.
